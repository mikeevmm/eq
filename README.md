# eq

## Install

**Consider using [`pipx`][pipx].**

```bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/mikeevmm/eq/
```

Otherwise, if you are using `pip`:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/mikeevmm/eq/
```

## Requirements

`eq` requires `xclip`, `imagemagick`, and `pdflatex`.

## How to Use

```
eq [--density=<n>]
```

`eq` will launch your default editor (and fallback on `$VISUAL`, `$EDITOR`, `vim`, `nano`, in that order). Write your equation (and edit the LaTeX file as required), and quit. Your equation will be compiled and copied to your clipboard.

If `eq` detects that you did not change your file, it quits.

The `--density` option determines the quality of your PDF to PNG conversion. Set a higher number for a crisper image. (Default value is 300.)

## Details

A temporary project is created, by default, in `/tmp`. You can change this directory by setting the `$EQ_PROJ_DIR` environment variable.
